# Research Methods in Interdisciplinary Science

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Research Methods in Interdisciplinary Science course, designed for Master and Pre-Doctoral students specializing in Climate Change, Sustainability Science, Urban Development, and Heritage Management.

This repository houses a comprehensive collection of materials from our previously conducted course, including lecture slides, example datasets, and R code for practical sessions. The course places a strong emphasis on quantitative methods, ensuring students gain hands-on experience with statistical and computational techniques, rather than qualitative methods.

## Repository Contents
**Lecture Slides:** Detailed presentations covering key concepts and frameworks.

**Example Data:** Real-world datasets for practical analysis.

**R Code:** Scripts and tutorials to support practical sessions and assignments.

## Preparation for the Course
To ensure you are fully prepared for the class and practical sessions, please complete the following tasks before the course begins:

## Important Note
The lecture slides available in this repository were developed for previous courses and can be used as references. The updated versions of the slides will be uploaded after each lecture.
